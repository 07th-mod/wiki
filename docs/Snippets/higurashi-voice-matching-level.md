### What are the Voice Matching Level / Censorship options?

The mod menu and/or **F2** key can set the script censorship level from PC (0, least censored) to Console (5, most censored)

* The higher the number/more censored, the more voices you will get. Lower levels will have less voices at scenes cut from the console release.
    * This is because the voices are taken from the censored, Console versions of the game, so no voices exist for the PC uncensored dialogue.

* We recommend leaving at the default level (2), which should be the most balanced option with censorship being minimal. Using this option, only copyright changes, innuendos, and a few word changes will be changed.
    * Max (5) = Use voiced lines from PS3 script as much as possible (censored at parts)
    * Min (0) = Original PC script with voices where it fits (fully uncensored)
    * Default (2) = Should be the most balanced option

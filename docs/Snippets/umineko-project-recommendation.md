!!! warning "Alternate mod recommendation"
    While the <nobr>07th-Mod</nobr> team attempts to provide the best Umineko experience possible, the engine that Mangagamer used prevents implementation of PS3 features such as lip sync, sprite/background/rain animations, song subtitles, line jump within the backlog, and several others. As these features would require difficult engine-level modifications, we do not plan to implement them.

    If you are able to emulate or hack a Nintendo Switch, and you do not rely on PC-specific features such as Ryukishi/Pachinko sprites or original backgrounds, we recommend patching the Switch game to run in English instead. You may find instructions on how to do so [here](https://andolga.github.io/umineko-catbox-english/).

# How to get Installer support

Support is currently available in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/pf5VhF9) and on [Github Issues](https://github.com/07th-mod/python-patcher/issues/new/choose).

When looking for support, keep in hand the following:

- a description, screenshots and/or error messages of the issue
- the [installation log](#finding-the-installation-log)

Having the [installation log](#finding-the-installation-log) is essential to troubleshoot issues, so don't forget to upload it as an attachment to your message.

The next section will help you find where the logs are commonly stored by the installer software.

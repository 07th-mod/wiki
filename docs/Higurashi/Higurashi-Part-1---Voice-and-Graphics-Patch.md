# Installing the patch

!!! warning "News: Windows-only installer end-of-life announcement"
    As of May 2019, we dropped support for the old Windows-only installer. The new installer has much better compatibility, works on Windows, Linux and Mac, and has an entirely new UI.

The installer combines all the patches available to create the best experience possible. It will automatically download and install the following content:

* Full voiceover
* PS3 backgrounds and CGs in Full HD
* PS3 sprites with lipsync in 1440p
* Updated MangaGamer sprites in 1440p
* Upgraded user interface
* Opening videos
* **(NEW!)** Revert to old Higurashi soundtrack and sound effects

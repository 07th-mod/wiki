## Using the installer

1. On the web page that was just launched, click on the mod you want to install.
2. Fill in your game path, and mod options as applicable, then start the installation.
3. If you wish to stop an install that is in progress, you MUST either click the **Quit Installer** button, or close the terminal. If you just close the webpage, the install will still run in the background!
4. When the install finishes, "The install was successful!" will be displayed. Please carefully read the information that is displayed, which may contain gotchas/extra tasks you may need to do.

## Flag Monitor

The flag monitor is a developer debug screen where you can see certain parameters that can be triggered by the shortcuts above. It can only be opened **and** closed in-game, meaning that menus will interfere with its functionality. This feature has no use other than checking keyboard shortcuts and checking flags.

### Left side panel: [MOD SETTINGS]

* ADV-MODE = ON/OFF
    * Changes the textbox mode. ADV-MODE ON will play with the textbox at the bottom, and ADV-MODE OFF will play with the textbox covering the whole screen like the original.
* Lip-Sync = ON/OFF
    * Toggles the lipsync feature. When turned on, the character mouth will move when playing voice clips.
* Alternative BGM = ON/OFF
    * **This feature is unused**
* Alternative BGM Flow = 0 (doesn't change)

* Voice Matching Level = 0/1/2 (default)/3/4/5
    * Changes the script censorship from PC (0) to console (5), with console being the most censored. The highest the number, the more voices you will get. Lower levels will have less voices at scenes cut from the console release.
    * We recommend leaving at the default level (2), which should be the most balanced option with censorship being minimal (usually copyright changes, innuendos and a few word changes).

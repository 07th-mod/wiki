We highly recommend reading this entire page. But here is the summary version:

- If you have problems, check the [Troubleshooting](Umineko-Part-0-TroubleShooting-and-FAQ.md) page
- If you have any existing save slots, and you **mod** or **upgrade** the game, your Save Slots WILL **randomly jump you somewhere in the game**. This can cause spoilers. Therefore, don't modify the game while you're in the middle of a chapter (read below for more details).
- There is a mod settings menu in-game that you should look at at least once.
- Updating the mod is not properly supported.
- Steam Sync is disabled. To enable it, run `enable steam sync.bat' in the game folder (see 'Known Issues' for reasoning).
- The old ryushiki sprites are not properly supported (see below)

## Regarding Saves and Chapter Progress (Please Read)

Saves Slots are NOT compatible between the stock game and the patched game. Save slots between different versions of the patched game may not be compatible - they might skip you forwards / backwards in the script (the `0.u` file). For this reason,  **you should only update your script after completing an episode**.

Chapter Progress (whether you have completed a particular chapter or not) IS compatible between the stock and patched game. If you lose your chapter progress, use the 'Unlock' button next to each chapter to unlock it. Make sure not to miss out on the tea-parties or ???? if you use the unlock button.

## Updating from older versions

We don't properly support updating the game, but you can do it by re-installing the game over an existing installation (either manually or automatically). If you chose to keep your 

As per the above, save files are not compatible when we update the game. Therefore, **you should only update your script after completing an episode**. If you update your game while in the middle of a chapter, you risk your save files to stop working, or your save files randomly jumping you forward in the game!

You can check for major updates in the [Mod Options - News](Umineko-Mod-Options.md#news) section.

## Mod Settings

You can change some settings from the in-game mod menu. While playing the game and the text is not animating, right click to bring up the menu. Click the right hand side options/menu button. This shows the options allowing you to change the music and voice volume.

## Known Issues
- Steam Sync is disabled (See [the "Steam Sync doesn't work!" FAQ](Umineko-Part-0-TroubleShooting-and-FAQ.md#steam-sync-doesnt-work) if you wish to re-enable it)
- For the Question Arcs, the voice quality near the start of the game is poor for some characters (sounds like a phasing effect). The raw PS3 audio files have this problem as well, so I don't think we can fix this. 

## Disclaimer about old 'Ryushiki' sprites 

The old 'Ryushiki' sprites are not *fully* supported, as described below:

- For the Question Arcs, you toggle sprites via the right-click menu. 
- The Answer arcs CANNOT do this. 
- There may be some bugs when the old sprites are used

If you really want to play with old sprites, you have the following options:

- Play Question and Answer arcs using the 'Voice only' option
- Play Question arcs with the 1080p patch, and Answer arcs with the 'voice only' option (and try to ignore the background art style changes)
- I have attempted to make a special script which allows you to use old sprites on the Answer Arcs, but it is not properly supported. It is listed in the 'Unsupported Options' on the 'Mod Options' page.

# 2. Mod Options

--8<-- "umineko-project-recommendation.md"

This page describes each mod option, so you can decide which mod to install.

Please do not expect the same mod features as the Higurashi mod, as Umineko runs on an entirely different engine to Higurashi. [Please see the "Higurashi Mod Feature Comparison"](Umineko-Getting-started.md#higurashi-mod-feature-comparison).

!!! tip "What is ADV Mode?"
    Some install options below refer to ADV mode. The normal mode for the Umineko games is 'NVL' (Novel mode), where the text occupies the entire screen. 'ADV' mode (Adventure Mode)  is where the text only occupies the bottom of the screen.

## Mod Options for Question Arcs Ch. 1~4

There are two main install options for the question arcs - the full patch, and the voice only patch. We highly recommend using the **[Installer](Umineko-Part-3a-Cross-Platform-Installer.md)** for installation, as installing [manually](Umineko-Part-1.1---Voices-only-Patch.md) is very error-prone.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Patch Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Full Patch</td>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li>Has <strong>ADV mode</strong> which can be toggled on or off at any time.</li>
                    <li>Playing with <strong>Japanese</strong> Text is supported <strong>ONLY IN NVL MODE</strong>. ADV mode + Japanese text is NOT supported.</li>
                    <li>Adds PS3 voices, sprites, CGs (event images), backgrounds, to the base game. DOES NOT add shader effects or lipsync.</li>
                    <li>Optional packs if you want Pachinko or Ryukishi sprites - See below.</li>
                    <li>5GB Download, 20GB free space required</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Voice-only</td>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adds voices to the base game (no other major changes)</li>
                    <li>Note that the voice-only Answer arcs do not support <strong>Japanese</strong> Text. Technically the voice-only Question arcs do support Japanese text, but you won't be able to play the same way when you get to the Answer arcs, so <strong>it is not recommended.</strong></li>
                    <li>1.9GB Download, 5GB free space required</li>
                </ul>

## Other installer-only options

There are some additional options you can choose, but they are only available in the installer. You can read the description of these options in the installer itself.

----

## Pachinko or Old Ryukishi Sprites

We have recently added options in the installer and manual download packs for the Pachinko and Ryukishi sprites. Note that you can only have ONE pack installed at a time - you CANNOT toggle PS3/Pachinko/Ryukishi while the game is running. Installing these packs will do the following:

- Overwrite most* of the PS3 sprites, causing Pachinko/Ryukishi sprites to be shown
- PS3 CGs and special effects will still be shown unchanged
- The PS3 backgrounds will also remain the same

\* The Pachinko sprites are missing a few characters who don't appear very often. The missing characters are substituted with PS3 sprites.

You must still install the base "PS3" graphics pack for each game, even if you only want Pachinko or Ryukishi sprites - these sprite packs do not replace the main graphics pack.

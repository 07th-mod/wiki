# Miotsukushi FAQ

## Why are there three different Miotsukushi arcs?

There are two completely different arcs, and one of those arcs has two different versions of it.

Miotsukushi was an original arc created for the PS2 release of Higurashi that serves as an alternate ending for the entire series. When the game was ported to the Nintendo DS some small but significant changes were made to the story, and a full-arc length segment was inserted into the middle to serve as the conclusion for the new console arc stories. When it was later ported to the PS3 the segment in the middle was pulled out and placed in a separate arc called Miotsukushi Ura, and the rest was called Omote. So Miotsukushi Omote is the same arc as Mio PS2, but with those additional changes made in the DS version.

Some of those story changes are controversial, which is why the mod allows you to play the PS2 or PS3 version.

## What order do I read these arcs in?

The PS3 version allows you to read Omote and Ura in either order. Reading Ura first might make for a slightly better experience, but the difference is minor so the choice is up to you. If you actually want to be consistent with the DS version, read Omote until the end of day 10, then read Ura, then the rest of Omote.

If you're not interested in the side stories with the new characters, you can simply read Mio PS2 or Omote without reading Ura.

## What are the differences between Miotsukushi PS2 and Omote

**Note: The list below contains spoilers.** Don't read on unless you're cool with that.

This list only includes the noteworthy differences. There are also some minor tweaks to wording throughout the arc

Issues happen more often than you think, and you should not feel ashamed or discouraged from reporting them. May it be a bug or just having trouble setting up the patch, we will always do our best to help you.

When reporting an issue, there is a few things we find really helpful:

* Always report issues in their respective repositories
    * Really, stop reporting issues here! The *"guide"* repository should only have issues about the guide itself!
    * Umineko Question Arcs issues should go on [Umineko Question Arcs issues](https://github.com/07th-mod/umineko-question/issues), Higurashi Meakashi issues should go on [Higurashi Meakashi issues](https://github.com/07th-mod/meakashi/issues) and the list goes on. Make sure you're reporting it in the right place.

* Provide helpful information
    * When you have an issue or find something, the more you add to the issue, the faster we can fix it. Installation issues? See if there is a log in the game folder and attach it. Post screenshots, post computer specs, post your operation system, post reproduction steps, anything will do. **Remember that your issue might happen to someone else**, think about those who found your issue by googling it.

* Don't push the buttons you don't need
    * *Milestone*, *assignees*, *projects*. Most likely you won't need them, so let them quiet. You should only use the *label* one.

* Be helpful
    * We will most likely ask a bunch of questions. Be patient and be around to answer them.
    * Sometimes we might ask you to test a few things. Try to be helpful as well.
    * Close your issue if you don't need a fix anymore, sometimes we don't know if it worked or not.

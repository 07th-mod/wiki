# Uninstalling Umineko and the Mod

If you want to fully remove Umineko (for a reinstall, or if you're finished with the game), follow these instructions. Note that **a normal Steam uninstall will not remove the mod files**, so you must follow these instructions to remove the mod files from your computer.

We currently don't offer any way to uninstall just the mod by itself - **the below process will uninstall both the game and the mod.**

## Before you Uninstall - Save Files

On a modded Umineko, saves are usually stored in the `mysav` folder, inside the game folder. Thus, **Uninstalling the game will usually also remove your saves**, so please backup your save files if you wish to keep them.

If you can't find your saves, see this FAQ, ["My save files have disappeared or changed unexpectedly"](Umineko-Part-0-TroubleShooting-and-FAQ.md#my-save-files-have-disappeared-or-changed-unexpectedly) for more information about alternate locations for Umineko saves.

## Uninstalling the game and mod files

1. Locate the game folder, **and remember it for later**, using the instructions below:
    1. Steam Users
        1. Open Steam
        2. Right click on the game to uninstall, then click "Properties"
        3. Click the "Local Files" tab
        4. Click the "Browse Local Files..." button. This will open the game folder.
    2. GOG and MangaGamer Users
        1. You'll need to know where you installed the game, or use the game shortcut to find where it was installed
2. Uninstall the game normally using Steam/GOG/Mangagamer launcher or add/remove programs
3. Manually delete the game folder you found earlier. This will ensure the mod files are fully removed.

The main thing to do here is to run the compiler script `higurashi:full-arc-upgrade`. See the [compiler documentation](https://github.com/07th-mod/higurashi-dev-guides/wiki/How-to-use-higurashi-patch-compiler#higurashifull-arc-upgrade-arc) for details.

TODO: things to do before running the script, things to do after running the script, possibly a video covering the work with fixing bugs etc.

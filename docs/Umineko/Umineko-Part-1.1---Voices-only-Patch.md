So, you like the Ryukishi art. I get it, I also like it a lot. In that case, we got you covered.

Beware that some bugs and features might be missing in the voice-only patch, as compared to the 'full patch'.

#### Manual Install Instructions (not recommended)

Manually installing the game is not recommended unless you have problems with the automatic installer. 

#### MAC USERS ONLY - Various Gotchas
- When overwriting one folder with another on Mac, it by default **entirely replaces** the folder rather than merging. To fix this see the instructions for "Merge two folders with the same name" here: [https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25633?locale=en_US](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25633?locale=en_US)
- MacOSX has some security features which can prevent the game running correctly. Please follow the install instructions closesly so this doesn't happen.

## Installing the patch

1. Find and open your game folder (open your Steam library, choose the game from the list, right click on it and click on ``Properties``. Switch to the ``LOCAL FILES`` tab and click on ``Browse local files...``)
2. Rename the file ``0.utf`` to ``0_old.utf`` (Backup the original script)
3. Download the ``0.u``, and place it inside the game folder. **MacOSX Only**: you might need to rename the `0.u` file to `0.utf`
4. Download and extract the Umineko Voices archive.
5. When you extracted the voice archive, it should have generated an `arc4.nsa` and `arc5.nsa` file.
If you have the MangaGamer release, you MUST rename this file to `arc1.nsa` and `arc2.nsa` so the game will detect it (otherwise you will get no voices).
**Steam users can skip this step** (they should already have an `arc1.nsa`, `arc2.nsa`, and `arc3.nsa` in their game folder).
6. This step differs depending on your operating system
    - **Windows, Linux**: Download the Windows/Linux executable, and overwrite the existing executable in the game folder 
    - **MacOSX**: Download the zip file, but extract it to a known good location like desktop/downloads/documents, OUTSIDE the game directory. This will give you a `.app` file. Only then, copy the `.app` file into the game directory. This is to avoid a MacOSX security feature which prevents the game from running correctly (will give you a 'script not found').  

7. **Answer Arcs only:** Extract the file ``UminekoChiruVO-Update1.zip`` the game folder. Overwrite if asked.
8. **Linux and Mac**: Extract the file `linux-libpng-libjpeg.7z` to the game folder. Overwrite if asked. Both arcs use the same archive.

Umineko Tsubasa and Hane are two sets of bonus short stories written by Ryukishi.
This page describes the installation process for our Tsubasa and Hane modifications,
which include an improved English translation, PS3 graphics and ADV mode.

!!! warning "The Tsubasa and Hane patches currently have no voice-acting! This is because Alchemist never actually released those games and, therefore, they were never voiced at all. If, at some point, a voiced version of these games is released, we'll attempt to add the voices to the patch."

!!! warning "Tsubasa and Hane only work on Windows. They were never released for Linux and OS X. This applies to the modded version as well."

!!! danger "To the best of our knowledge, Tsubasa and Hane are currently not officially for sale anywhere. You may find used copies for sale online, but we cannot assist you with exact locations where you might be able to obtain these games."

## Automatic installer

You may use our [Automatic Installer](Umineko-Part-3a-Cross-Platform-Installer.md) to install the Tsubasa and Hane patches.
However, since the games aren't available on Steam, the installer will not be able to auto-detect their install location.
You will need to manually locate either the executable file (`うみねこのなく頃に翼.exe` for Tsubasa and `うみねこのなく頃に羽.exe` for Hane)
or the "snow.dll" file inside of the game folder for the installer to recognise the install location.
After the installation finishes, read how to [run the mod](#running-the-modded-version) down below.

## Manual installation

If, for whatever reason, the manual installation does not work or you do not wish to use our automated installer, you may install the modification manually. To do this, first download the mod archive for your game from the table below.

|Tsubasa|Hane|
|-|-|
|[Download (~300MB)](https://07th-mod.com/Bern/Tsubasa/umineko-tsubasa-ons.zip)|[Download (~100MB)](https://07th-mod.com/Bern/Hane/umineko-hane-ons.zip)

Once downloaded, extract the archive into your game directory. *PRESERVE THE TOP-LEVEL FOLDER*. The \[07th-Mod\] folder should *remain* after the archive extraction, do not put files from inside of the folder into the game directory -- put the folder itself there.
After you extract the archive, read how to [run the mod](#running-the-modded-version) below.

## Running the modded version

Locate the folder which you have installed Tsubasa or Hane to. From there, navigate to the \[07th-Mod\] subfolder, and run the executable program (.exe file) inside. For Tsubasa, the file is called `[07th-Mod] Umineko Tsubasa.exe`, and for Hane the filename is `[07th-Mod] Umineko Hane.exe`. Do not run the original executables for the game as they will result in starting the unmodded version. However, do not delete anything from the base game directory either -- the original files are required for the mod to work correctly.

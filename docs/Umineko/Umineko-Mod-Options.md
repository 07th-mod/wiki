# 2. Mod Options

This page describes each mod option, so you can decide which mod to install.

!!! tip "What is ADV Mode?"
    Some install options below refer to ADV mode. The normal mode for the Umineko games is 'NVL' (Novel mode), where the text occupies the entire screen. 'ADV' mode (Adventure Mode)  is where the text only occupies the bottom of the screen.

----
!!! tip "Should I get the Windows or Cross Platform Installer?"
    Use the **Windows Installer** installer on Windows. Use the **Cross Platform Installer** when the Windows installer can't be used, such as on Mac and Linux, and for the Voice Only mod option.

## News
28-01-2019: Cross Platform Installer is now suggested in install instructions. Wiki has been refactored.

28-01-2019: Add ADV mode to 1080p Question Arcs

17-11-18: Add beta version of 1080p Question Arcs (previously resolution was 960p, resulting in some blurriness). You can install it via the installer or manually. Add ability to toggle language with 'Tab' button.

2-10-18: Add Japanese Language mode (thanks Naoki!). Note: currently doesn't work for "Voice Only" or answer arcs "ADV mode", due to those versions using a different script.

15-07-18: Some small changes to both arcs (to update you need both the latest script file and the latest update zip)
- For Question arcs only, add the option to view the original game's videos since some consider the PS3 openings too spoilery. (Question arcs issue #101)
- Use English title logo for Question arcs (Question arcs issue #100)
- Fix transparency of images for one scene for Answer arcs (use alphablend mode images)

06-06-18: For Chiru Arcs only, minor update to script and assets (see issue [#47](https://github.com/07th-mod/umineko-answer/issues/47))

I will try to list some configurations of the game and how to enable them here. If something seems missing, you can raise an issue on the [Umineko Question](https://github.com/07th-mod/umineko-question/issues) or [Umineko Answer](https://github.com/07th-mod/umineko-answer/issues) repository.

The two games have been **patched using different methods**, so **don't expect the Question and Answer arcs to behave the same!**.

### How to replace scripts

Some instructions tell you to "replace the script". This involves:

- downloading the script file (called `0.utf`)
- replacing the script in your game folder (called `0.u` for Windows and Linux users, and `0.utf` for MacOSX users). 

**Remember to rename the downloaded 0.utf to 0.u on Windows and Linux, otherwise it won't work!** 
Make sure you didn't download a .html file by mistake - download by right clicking the link, then clicking "save as".

### Question Arc Modes:
- [Full patch (sprites, graphics, voices)](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Umineko/Umineko-Part-1---Voice-and-Graphics-Patch) - tries to be as similar to the PS3 release as possible. 
    - Full patch with "Old Old" ryushiki sprites - To use this mode, install the full patch. Start a new game. Once you can open the right click menu, click "system", then click the "To Orig." button on the top left hand corner.
    - Full patch with Pachinko/Steam/MangaGamer sprites - To use this mode, install the full patch. Then, rename the 'tati' folder (located at `Umineko\big\bmp\tati`) to 'tati_old' (or you can just delete it). Since the game can't find the PS3 sprites, it will revert to 'default' pachinko sprites

- [Voice only patch](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Umineko/Umineko-Part-1.1---Voices-only-Patch) - patches only the voices and nothing else

- **NOT SUPPORTED**: ADV Mode - Adv mode is **not yet available** for Question Arcs, as we haven't done it yet. While some work has been done on it, we can't promise a release date :(

- Japanese Language: Use the Japanese Language toggle in-game or press 'Tab'. Currently not supported when using the "voice only" script.

### Answer Arc Modes:
- [Full patch (sprites, graphics, voices)](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Umineko/Umineko-Part-1---Voice-and-Graphics-Patch) - tries to be as similar to the PS3 release as possible. 
    - Full patch with Ryushiki sprites or Pachinko Sprites - To use this mode, you need replace your script with this one: [RIGHT CLICK here and SAVE AS](https://github.com/07th-mod/umineko-answer/raw/old_sprites/0.utf). Once you have replaced your game script, use the "To Orig." button in the top left of the right click menu if you want the "Old Old" ryushiki sprites". Note that this mode hasn't been well tested.

- [Voice only patch](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Umineko/Umineko-Part-1.1---Voices-only-Patch) - patches only the voices and nothing else

- ADV Mode - The game normally displays in "NoVeL/NVL" mode - that is the text covers the entire screen, and the screen is darkened. In "ADVenture/Textbox/Dating Sim" mode, like most modern visual novels, the text displays in a small box at the bottom of the screen, and the screen is not darkened.

- Japanese Language: Use the Japanese Language toggle in-game or press 'Tab'. Currently not supported when using "voice only" or "ADV Mode" scripts.

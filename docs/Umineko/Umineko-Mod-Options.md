# 2. Mod Options

This page describes each mod option, so you can decide which mod to install.

!!! tip "What is ADV Mode?"
    Some install options below refer to ADV mode. The normal mode for the Umineko games is 'NVL' (Novel mode), where the text occupies the entire screen. 'ADV' mode (Adventure Mode)  is where the text only occupies the bottom of the screen.

!!! warning "News: Windows-only installer end-of-life announcement"
    As of May 2019, we dropped support for the old Windows-only installer. The new installer has much better compatibility, works on Windows, Linux and Mac, and has an entirely new UI.

## Mod Options for Question Arcs Ch. 1~4

There are two main install options for the question arcs - the full patch, and the voice only patch. We highly recommend using the **installers**, as installing manually is very error-prone.

- Has **ADV mode** which can be toggled on or off at any time.
- Playing with Japanese Text is supported
- Adds PS3 voices, sprites, CGs (event images), backgrounds, to the base game. DOES NOT add shader effects or lipsync.
- Install Methods: [Cross Platform Installer](Umineko-Part-3a-Cross-Platform-Installer.md) || [Install Manually](Umineko-Part-1---Voice-and-Graphics-Patch.md)
- Optional packs if you want Pachinko or Ryukishi sprites - See below.

#### Question Arcs - Voice only (~1.9GB Download, ~5GB free space required)

- Mainly adds voices to the base game

## Pachinko or Old Ryukishi Sprites

We have recently added options in the installer and manual download packs for the Pachinko and Ryukishi sprites. Note that you can only have ONE pack installed at a time - you CANNOT toggle PS3/Pachinko/Ryukishi while the game is running. Installing these packs will do the following:

- Overwrite most* of the PS3 sprites, causing Pachinko/Ryukishi sprites to be shown
- PS3 CGs and special effects will still be shown unchanged
- The PS3 backgrounds will also remain the same

\* The Pachinko sprites are missing a few characters who don't appear very often. The missing characters are substituted with PS3 sprites.

You must still install the base "PS3" graphics pack for each game, even if you only want Pachinko or Ryukishi sprites - these sprite packs do not replace the main graphics pack.

28-01-2019: Add ADV mode to Full Patch of Question Arcs

17-11-18: Add beta version of Question Arcs in 1080p resolution (previously resolution was 960p, resulting in some blurriness). You can install it via the installer or manually. Add ability to toggle language with 'Tab' button.

??? bug "Linux Users: GNOME Desktop and Ubuntu causes Game Crash - Workaround"
    GNOME Desktop (the default on Ubuntu) will cause Higurashi Ep.4 and upwards to **crash the entire desktop**. This happens even on the base game (without any mods applied). A workaround for this is to install XFCE desktop. You can follow [this guide](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-xubuntu-desktop-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux) to install XFCE desktop (it can be installed alongside GNOME). Please make sure you can launch the base game before applying any mods (for ease of installation, please don't make any saves on the base game).

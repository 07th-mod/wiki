!!! warning "Alternate mod recommendation"
    While the <nobr>07th-Mod</nobr> team attempts to provide the best Umineko experience possible, the engine that Mangagamer used prevents implementation of PS3 features such as lip sync, sprite/background/rain animations, song subtitles, line jump within the backlog, and several others. As these features would require difficult engine-level modifications, we do not plan to implement them.

    Another team, <nobr>[Umineko Project](https://umineko-project.org)</nobr>, has created a complete port of the PS3 game to PC. Unless you are looking for some specific feature that exists in our mod but not in theirs (such as NVL mode support or alternate spritesets), we highly recommend you check out their version of the game instead.

    Note that we **cannot provide any support for <nobr>Umineko Project</nobr>**, as our team did not develop that version and does not maintain it.

!!! warning "Be careful with old save files!"
    Save files from older versions of the patch **or** the vanilla game are not expected to work properly with our patch. They might look fine sometimes, but you will hit a roadblock eventually. We recommend to start fresh from the beggining or use the "Chapter Select" function to start at the current chapter you were playing before. You can also hold ``ctrl`` to skip the game in high speed mode.

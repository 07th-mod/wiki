Quick Rundown of modes:
- ADV Mode is where text appears in a textbox at the bottom of the screen, instead of convering the entire screen. [Click Here](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Umineko/Umineko-Part-1---Voice-and-Graphics-Patch#adv--textbox-mode-for-chiru-only) for screenshots. The original PS3 game shipped with this mode.
- Voice: All the voices from the PS3 game
- Graphics: Graphics from the PS3 game, including sprites, CGs, backgrounds, etc. Certain features like shader effects and lipsync from the PS3 game aren't available.
- Old Sprites: Sprites from the original game (Ryushiki Sprites) or Steam Sprites (Pachinko Sprites)
- Japanese: Japanese mode isn't supported by us at the moment. There exists a script for the Question Arcs but it has not been maintained.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

See the [Troubleshooting](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Umineko/Umineko-Part-0-TroubleShooting-and-FAQ) page.

## Known Issues
- For the Question Arcs, the voice quality near the start of the game is poor for some characters (sounds like a phasing effect). The raw PS3 audio files have this problem as well, so I don't think we can fix this. 

## News
15-07-18: Some small changes to both arcs (to update you need both the latest script file and the latest update zip)
- For Question arcs only, add the option to view the original game's videos since some consider the PS3 openings too spoilery. (Question arcs issue #101)
- Use English title logo for Question arcs (Question arcs issue #100)
- Fix transparency of images for one scene for Answer arcs (use alphablend mode images)

06-06-18: For Chiru Arcs only, minor update to script and assets (see issue [#47](https://github.com/07th-mod/umineko-answer/issues/47))

05-05-18: For Question Arcs only, fix some missing voice delays.

01-05-18: Update all .exes to give a reminder if you forget to rename the `0.utf` to `0.u` instead of the generic/incorrect error message. Backup of the old .exes can be found [here](https://github.com/07th-mod/resources/releases/download/Beato/umineko_exe_backup_2018-05-01.7z).

13-04-18: Add [missing Maria/Rosa Alternate Sprites](https://github.com/07th-mod/umineko-question/issues/93) to the merged update pack (pack v4 cumulative) for Question Arcs only.

02-04-18: Question arc script was updated to fix voice/unvoiced delay bugs.

# Mod Installer

The following page provides instructions on running the mod installer. Once the installer wizard has started, please refer to the individual wiki pages for Higurashi and Umineko on what each install option means, FAQs, and troubleshooting.

## Windows

- Download the [Windows Installer Archive](http://07th-mod.com/installer/python/higu_win_installer.zip).
- Extract the zip file to a folder, with the following requirements:
    - The folder must be on the  **same drive** (eg C: drive) as the game.
    - The folder must not require any special permissions for write access.
    - If you're not sure which folder to use, your `Downloads` folder will probably work fine, assuming it's on the same drive as the game.
- Run the file called `install.bat`

NOTE: If your operating system is 32-bit, you can use the [32-bit version of the installer](http://07th-mod.com/installer/python/higu_win_installer.zip)

## Mac

TBD

## Linux

In short, you must have Python (2 or 3), 7zip, and Aria2 installed on your computer. Then, run `higurashiInstaller.py`.

- Install Python (Python 2 and 3 are both supported)
- Install 7zip (7z or 7za)
- Install Aria2 (aria2c)
- Download and run [higurashiInstaller.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/07th-mod/resources/master/higurashiInstaller.py) . If you cannot double click the file, please run `python higurashiInstaller.py`

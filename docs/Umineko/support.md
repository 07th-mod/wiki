When asking for support, please provide the following:

- A description, screenshots and/or error messages of the issue. Some text near where the problem occurs also helps us locate when in the game you are encountering the issue.
- If you have an issue with the game itself crashing or behaving very badly, submit the game log and save files:

## Getting the game log

  1. To get the game log Windows:
      - Start the game in Debug mode by double clicking `Umineko1to4_DebugMode.bat` or `Umineko5to8_DebugMode.bat`, located in the game folder.
      - An folder will immediately popup showing the `stdout.txt` and `stderr.txt` files, but don't submit them yet.
      - Play the game until you make game crash, then submit the `stdout.txt` and `stderr.txt` text files to us.
  2. On Linux or Mac you can view errors by launching the game from a console windows

## Getting the save files

The mod's save files are located in the `mysav` folder:

- The folder is usually inside the game directory. For example:<br>`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Umineko\mysav`
- Sometimes located outside the game directory ([See this FAQ](http://07th-mod.com/wiki/Umineko/Umineko-Part-0-TroubleShooting-and-FAQ/#steam-sync-doesnt-work)). Try checking your Steam folder for save files too `[PATH_TO_STEAM_FOLDER]\Steam\steamapps\common\Umineko\mysav`

### Native vs Wine/Proton Background Information

There are two methods of running the game on Linux:

1. Running the Native Linux version of the game
2. Running the Windows version of the game on Linux  using Proton (Steam/Mangagamer/GOG) or Wine (Mangagamer/GOG)

As some users have issues with the Native Linux version of the game, we recommend the following:

#### Higurashi Mods

- **If you bought from Steam**, it is suggested you enable Proton before installing the mod to avoid the above problems. See the instructions below.

- **If you bought from GOG/Mangagamer**:

    - We suggest trying the Native Linux version of the game first
    - If you have problems with the native version, you can try Wine (plain Wine, using Lutris, or using Minigalaxy (GOG only)). **However you will need to research how to do this yourself.** (If anyone wants to provide a tutorial for this, please let us know.)
    - You might only encounter issues with the Native version when reaching Chapter 5 onwards

#### Umineko Mods

- We haven't done much testing of using Wine/Proton for Umineko. Try the native version (or on Steam, whatever Steam recommends), then if you have problems, you can try the Wine/Proton version.

!!! info "If you're not sure if you installed Native Linux or Wine/Proton, the installer will tell you after you've selected the game to be modded."

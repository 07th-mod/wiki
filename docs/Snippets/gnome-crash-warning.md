??? bug "Linux Users: GNOME/MATE Desktop (Ubuntu, Fedora...) causes Game Crash - Workaround"
    Warning: GNOME/MATE Desktop (the default on Ubuntu and Fedora Linux) will cause Higurashi to **crash the entire desktop when you start the game**. This happens even on the base game (without any mods applied).

    A workaround for this is to install XFCE desktop. You can follow [this guide](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-xubuntu-desktop-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux) to install XFCE desktop (it can be installed alongside GNOME).

    Please make sure you can launch the base game before applying any mods (please don't make any saves on the base game as they are not compatible with the mod).

# Installing the patch

!!! note
    Don't forget to check ["Patch configuration and extras"](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/Higurashi-Part-2---Patch-configuration-and-keyboard-shortcuts) after installing the patch manually or using the installer.

## Installer (Windows only)

The installer combines all the patches available to create the best experience possible. It will automatically download and install the following content:

* Full voiceover
* PS3 backgrounds and CGs in Full HD
* PS3 sprites with lipsync in 1440p
* Updated MangaGamer sprites in 1440p
* Upgraded user interface
* Opening videos

### How to use the Windows installer

1. Download the latest installer from [the Installer Releases page](https://github.com/07th-mod/Higurashi_Installer_WPF/releases/latest)
2. Open the software
3. You will be given the choice of Higurashi or Umineko - select the Higurashi dropdown
4. Choose the chapter you want to patch by clicking on the correct icon** (protip: mouse over the icons to see the banners for each chapter!)
5. Set the installation directory to your game directory **(supports Steam, GOG and MangaGamer releases)**
    * If you are unsure **where** the Steam game is located, open Steam and find it in your Steam library, right-click on it and choose ``Properties``. In the new window that just opened, click on the ``LOCAL FILES`` tab and then on the ``Browse local files...`` button. Windows Explorer will then open showing you where the game is installed
6. If the directory is correct, the software will validate the path and let you proceed with the installation
7. A progress bar and text will show the status of the installation

!!! warning
    As reported, some antivirus software might warn you about the installer. **This is a false positive**, and it happens because the installer is either new or not verified by the antivirus databases yet. The installer code can be freely accessed in our Github organization and will be only compiled from a trusted source.

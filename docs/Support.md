    Follow the [Support Checklist](support-checklist.md) to get your problem solved as fast as possible.


This page contains background information about support resources. If you just want to get a problem solved, follow the [Support Checklist](support-checklist.md).

## Getting support on Discord

If you are a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) user, we highly recommend [joining our server](https://discord.gg/pf5VhF9) (click here to join) to get support for simple issues. Usually, issues are solved faster there than on Github. Our Discord server has support channels for Higurashi, Umineko and also developer channels where you can ask broader questions about the patch. All channels are fine for installation issues, reporting bugs and general improvement of the patches (translation changes, graphical improvements, etc).


## Reporting issues on Github

[07th-Mod](https://github.com/07th-mod/) is an open-source group, meaning that our presence is much more meaningful on Github than on Discord. When there are convoluted issues that needs a lot of testing or fixes that are going to be deployed over time, we often recommend people to open an *issue* at a certain repository that relates to it. These issues are not only limited to getting help installing the patch or fixing small mistakes, they contribute a lot to our work because we can reference them and keep an open, static discussion that will not be buried over time.

If you don't know how to open an issue, create an account at Github [here](https://github.com/join) and read [this small guide on how to write issues](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue).

The bottom of the Support Checklist page contains [a list of repositories](support-checklist.md#submitting-via-github-issues) where you can submit issues.
  
You can find more repositories (mainly for developers) in our [Github organization](https://github.com/07th-mod/).


## Notes about log files

Please understand that log files might collect some information about your computer, such as:

* Where the game is installed (full path to game.exe)
* Your system username
* Your system specs (CPU, GPU, RAM and OS)

We do not receive these files unless you send them to us. Nothing is sent to our servers and no data is tracked by the patch. These files contain no sensitive information about your computer. You can open and read them using notepad or any text processor.

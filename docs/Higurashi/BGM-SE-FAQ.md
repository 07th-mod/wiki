## Higurashi Music and Sound Effects Changes / April Update

### What was the April update?

In April 2019, all the Higurashi games received a major update. This update changed the Background Music (BGM) and sound effects (SE). The changes made were:

- Some BGM/SE were replaced with completely different or new BGM/SE
    - In some cases, duplicates replaced existing BGM, resulting in less variation of BGM tracks
- Some BGM/SE are modified or re-recorded versions of the same BGM/SE
- Some BGM had their audio clipping and distortion fixed - but at the same time different sounding instruments or samples may have been used in the new version.
- The game script was modified in some places to play different songs. Since the mod uses it's own script, we are unaffected by this.
- MangaGamer forgot to update the game for some store + chapter combinations (such as GOG's Tsumihoroboshi Ch.6). So just because you downloaded the game recently, it doesn't mean you have the April 2019 update.

For more detailed information:

- We have an google doc which lists the name of every BGM used by our mod:
    - ["Higurashi BGM Filename to Music Name Mapping" spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CzZ6IBOPmDozdatWM2rol1DR2xjIaySSKY5XQV4yhdI/edit?usp=sharing)
    - **Please note this list is automatically generated and might not always be correct**
    - Please read the first sheet to understand the table
- Googling "April Update Higurashi" will give some forum posts with more information

### What options does the mod provide to fix this issue?

We offer the GIN's BGM/SE fixes which bring the BGM/SE closer (but definitely NOT identical to) the original Japanese release and/or Pre April Update - please see the below table. This option was previously called "Original BGM/SE" or "BGM Fix".

You can switch to this BGM/SE using the F10 mod menu, under the 'Audio' tab.

If you want exactly the same BGM/SE as the original Japanese release, we would suggest you play the original Japanese release, as the mod cannot replicate that BGM/SE exactly.

### Why are the Answer Arcs BGM fixed differently to the Question Arcs?

#### Question Arcs

The Question arcs have been fixed only by file replacement. No Timing changes have been made.

This is because the question arcs BGM changes are less severe, so it was decided it wasn't worthwhile to fix the timing.

For this reason, the question arcs BGM timing does not fully match the original game.

#### Answer Arcs

The Answer arcs have been fixed by both file replacement and adjusting the BGM timing

This is because major changes were found which couldn't be fixed any other way, even though doing so was time consuming

### Why are the Sound Effects taken from the Pre-April Update and not the original JP release?

Currently, the Sound Effects match the Pre-April Update (NOT the original JP release), and the Sound Effect timings have not been updated at all.

The two main reasons it's difficult to fix this are:

- The sound effects are very messy in the game scripts, and would take a long time to fix
- Our mod has changes to match the Console game, which further complicates fixing the SE

For these reasons, we have decided to leave the SE as the Pre-April Update versions.

### Higurashi BGM History

Because there are so many versions of Higurashi with different sets of BGM, I've decided to list them here in chronological order:

#### Original JP Higurashi Release (~2002) / MangaGamer EN Higurashi Question Arcs (Before April 2019)

When 07th Expansion originally released the question arcs, they had music from two different sources: AI-D-IA and Nerve. Nerve's tracks were released as MIDI files, which needed to be converted to wav files so they could be played in game. It's generally accepted that this conversion was not very good.

Before the April 2019 Update, MangaGamer releases also used this music for the Question arcs.

#### JP Higurashi Hou Compilation (2014)

The Japanese version of Hou still uses the AI-D-IA tracks, but Nerve's tracks were newly converted, apparently with his involvement.

More info on the Hou compilation: [Fandom "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Hou"](https://07th-expansion.fandom.com/wiki/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_Hou)

#### MangaGamer EN Higurashi Question (After April 2019 Update)

In April 2019, MG updated all their releases on request from 07th Expansion. I can't tell you what changed in the answer arcs, but the question arcs now had all of their AI-D-IA tracks replaced with new stuff. Some of these tracks never appeared anywhere else. Furthermore, they now used the Hou versions of Nerve's tracks.

#### JP Hou+ Demo (2020)

When 07th Expansion released the Hou+ demo, they also replaced all of the AI-D-IA tracks. Some of them with somewhat different versions of the tracks from MG's update, but many others with entirely new tracks.

Some info on the Hou Demo here: [Fandom "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Hou+"](https://07th-expansion.fandom.com/wiki/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_Hou%2B)

#### JP Hou+ Compilation (2022) / MangaGamer EN Hou+ Compilation (2023)

When 07th Expansion released the full version of Hou+, some of these replacement tracks saw slight alterations. And while most of Nerve's tracks stayed the way they've been since Hou, "Lie Lies-Lies Lie" and "Facism" were replaced with a new conversion for some reason.

## List of BGM/SE Oddities

This section explains some unexpected behavior you might encounter when using GIN's BGM/SE.

### GIN BGM/SE Oddities

#### Click Sound

The "click" sound (`wa_037.ogg`) and the "children laughing sound" (`wa_038.ogg`) are different between the Question and Answer arcs

- The pre-april update unmodded game had this same behavior. Because GIN's BGM/SE copies the SE from the pre-april update unmodded game, it has the same behavior for these two sound effects.

#### Title Screen Sound

The title screen background sound (sound of cicadas) is different between the Question  and Answer arcs (`lsys11.ogg`/`higurashi.ogg`)

- This is probably because the Question arcs use the pre-april update MangaGamer BGM, while the Answer arcs use the BGM from the original Japanese game.

#### Answer Arcs - GIN's BGM option sometimes plays BGM from the unmodded BGM folder

For the Answer Arcs, GIN's BGM does not override every single BGM (unlike the Question Arcs).

This means some BGM will be taken from the 'unmodded' BGM folder (`BGM`), and some BGM will be taken from the GIN BGM folder (`OGBGM`), even if you have GIN's BGM option selected.

For example:

 - In the April Update (`BGM` folder), `1.ogg` and `cafe.ogg` are the same BGM, "Boy in the Windmill".
 - But in GIN's BGM (`OGBGM` folder), `1.ogg` is "Afternoon in Paris", and `cafe.ogg` is missing (so `cafe.ogg` falls back to the April Update version "Boy in the Windmill").
    - In the right-click menu, it will state `BGM/cafe.ogg` is playing, even when GIN's BGM is selected

In this example, I think MangaGamer replaced `1.ogg` with `cafe.ogg` in the April Update, so to fix this change, only `1.ogg` needed to be overriden.

The following tracks are not overriden when using GIN's BGM option:

| **Chapter 5-8**      | **Chapter 5-8 (cont.)** | **Chapter 9**         |

### How do I check if the unmodded game has the Pre or Post April update BGM

The below checks (as far as we know) will tell you if you have the Pre or Post april update BGM

- For the Unmodded Question Arcs, you have the Post-april update BGM if the file `StreamingAssets/SE/wa_003.ogg` has CRC32 `0F8F4B01` (7zip can calculate CRC32's by right-clicking). Otherwise you have the Pre-April update BGM.
- For the Unmodded Answer Arcs, you have the Post-april update BGM if the file `StreamingAssets/BGM/bellflower.ogg` exists. Otherwise you have the Pre-April update BGM.

The GOG version of Ch.6 Tsumihoroboshi still has the Pre-April Update BGM as of 15/07/20203. This implies they forgot to update the game for some stores (eg. MangaGamer, GOG). So just because you have the latest install of the game, it doesn't mean you have the April Update BGM.

### `heigen2gm` by KeNji (`msys29.ogg`)

`heigen2gm` by KeNji (`msys29.ogg`) is present in nearly every release of Higurashi unchanged, except for MangaGamer's release of Hou+ and ancient versions of MangaGamer's Higurashi.

## Other Links

- The [BGM & SE Issues Index](https://github.com/07th-mod/higurashi-patch-compiler/issues/64) lists github issues which related to the BGM and SE.
    - If you're looking for open issues related to BGM/SE, or want to check the history of why something was changed, this might be a good place to start.

## Other BGM options

### Hou+ Demo BGM (by Kilicool64 - Added 2023/06/24)

This option replaces 16 BGM with BGM from the Higurashi Hou+ Demo. It uses the same tracks from nerve as the New MangaGamer BGM, but the AI-D-IA tracks are different.

Some are remastered versions of MangaGamer's replacements, while others were newly composed by xaki.

This option is not available for Chapters 5-8 and Rei because most of their music isn't in the Hou+ demo.

All other tracks will use the New MangaGamer BGM and GIN's/Original SE.

### Remake BGM

This option replaces nine BGM with handmade remakes of nine tracks from the original release (pre-2019).

You can listen to these tracks [on Radiata Alice's "Hinamizawa Syndrome Vol​.​1" BandCamp page](https://radiataalice.bandcamp.com/album/hinamizawa-syndrome-vol-1).

All other tracks will use the GIN's/OG BGM BGM/SE.

The following tracks are replaced:

- Tell a thing (piano solo ver.)
- Snow #3 'First snow'
- Days of Children #3
- Rainy Days
- Fascism
- Sunrise
- Gear
- Theme of Owner
- Dawn

This option is not available for Onikakushi Ch.1, as the chapter does not use any of these tracks.
This option is not available for Chapters 5-8 as an OST remake for those chapters hasn't been created.

## Question Arcs BGM Changelog

??? info "Click to Expand Question Arcs BGM Changelog"

    ### Version 1.3 - 2024-04-14 - drojf
    Various updates from Kilicool64 to ensure BGM consistency and add new BGM options. SE have not been changed.

    #### GIN's BGM / OGBGM
    - msys30.ogg/Meditation has been normalized to use the Hou Compilation (2014) version instead of the Original JP release/Old Mangagamer BGM version(2002) for consistency (all other tracks are already from the Hou Compilation (2014))
    - Other BGM have been re-converted at a higher bitrate, but otherwise are the same BGM

    #### April 2019 BGM
    - Added "April2019BGM" folder containing one BGM file, msys29.ogg / "Heigen wo Iku (Going to the Plains). This file is the same as the one that comes with the unmodded game, but higher quality.

    #### Hou+ Demo BGM
    - Renamed folder from HouPlusBGM to HouPlusDemoBGM to avoid confusion with Hou+ BGM option. Otherwise unchanged

    #### Hou+ BGM
    - Add Hou+ BGM (from Kilicool64)

    ### Version 1.2 - 2023-06-24 - drojf
    - Add Hou Plus Demo BGM

    ### Version 1.1 - 2022-11-05
    - Add BGM and OGBGM bgmInfo.json folder

    ### Version 1.0
    - Initial Release - unknown date

## Answer Arcs BGM Changelog

??? info "Click to Expand Answer Arcs BGM Changelog"

    ### Folder Descriptions
    - ExtraBGM/ExtraSE: This folder contains BGM which does not come with the game. For now, it contains some Question Arcs BGM/SE, and also some Console BGM. If we need to override any BGM in the BGM folder, we can also put those files here.
    - OGBGM/OGSE: This folder contains BGM/SE which plays when you have the OGBGM/GIN BGM option selected. This will override all the other folders.

    ### Version 1.6 - 2023-04-22

    Add missing BGM/bgmInfo.json file to fix "Unknown BGM" when using Mangagamer/unmodded BGM option

    ### Version 1.5 - 2022-01-06

    Revert the previous change - We already include the April Update BGM/SE in the MangaGamer-Answer-BGM-SE-Restore.7z, and the installer has been updated to make sure it is installed when needed.

    ### Version 1.4 - 2022-01-02

    It was found that the GOG versions of Chapters 5 and 6 have the pre-april update BGM.

    To keep BGM consistent across all versions, the BGM pack now includes the April Update BGM in the BGM folder, which will overwrite whatever existing BGM the game comes with.

    ### Version 1.3 - 2022-12-13
    - See https://github.com/07th-mod/higurashi-assembly/issues/100

    We had a problem where certain BGM were not playing on Linux - the game expects all assets to be lowercase and the following were not:
    - primal-beat-of-horrow_T.ogg
    - BIGBEAR

    I also updated the bgmInfo.json accordingly

    This only affects the answer OGBGM archive.

    ### Version 1.2 - 2022-11-13
    - See https://github.com/07th-mod/meakashi/issues/80#issuecomment-1312598536

    I just noticed there are the following BGM and SE in the Ch8 Voices archive (previously I thought there were no extra BGM/SE used in ch8):

        SE/wa_003.ogg
        BGM/msys06.ogg
        BGM/msys32.ogg

    Unfortunately, msys32 is not included in the BGM archive I updated, so I'll need to update it to add that one.

    ### Version 1.1 - 2022-11-04
    - See PR https://github.com/07th-mod/meakashi/issues/80
    - Add 'ExtraBGM' and 'ExtraSE' which mostly consists of BGM from the question arcs, but also a few BGM from the console game. These contain the post-april update BGM and SE of the question arcs tracks.
    - Add corresponding SE to the 'OGSE' folder to mirror the SE in 'ExtraSE' - these are taken from GIN's BGM
    - Update OGBGM folder (GIN BGM) msys17, msys23, msys27 to be consistent with question arcs
        - NOTE: I don't think the question arcs BGM (msysXX) are used if you have the OGBGM enabled, due to GIN's version of the script never using them. But I'm making them consistent anyway.
        - Previously, the OGBGM Question arcs used the remastered versions of these three songs, and the Answer arcs OGBGM used the original midi Japanese release's version. Now both OGBGM will use the remastered version.
            - There is an issue related to this: https://github.com/07th-mod/meakashi/issues/49
    - Add bgmInfo.json for BGM folders

    ### Version 1.0 - 2021-03-20
    - Merge the BGM and SE packs together
    - Rename 'BGM' and 'SE' to 'OGBGM' and 'OGSE', so the folders are separate can be switched between with the new DLL

## Hou+ BGM Changelog

??? info "Click to Expand Hou+ BGM Changelog"

    ### Version 1.3 - 2024-04-21

    - Add Post April 2019 BGM (so users who used this option in question arcs can have same BGM)

    - Update OGBGM
        - msys30.ogg/Meditation has been normalized to use the Hou Compilation (2014) version instead of the Original JP release/Old Mangagamer BGM version(2002) for consistency (all other tracks are already from the Hou Compilation (2014))
        - Some BGM have been re-converted at a higher bitrate, but otherwise are the same BGM

    Note: cracker3 (sound of firecracker) has no non-hou version, since it is only used in mehagashi which is exclusive to Hou+
    Note2: The following not added despite being referenced in the engine, since I can't find them in the SE folder
    sysse04

    ### Version 1.1 - 2024-02-18

    Add Hou (non-plus) OGSE

    The OGSE does not cover all sound effects.

    Also, many of the SE are the same between non-plus and plus versions

    ### Version 1.0 - 2024-01-30

    Initial Release

    > ok I've created an OGBGM pack here, complete with bgmInfo (bgm names) for both the original BGM and the Mangagamer BGM:

    See https://github.com/07th-mod/hou-plus/issues/2

### Note on used/unused Hou+ SE

The below expandable section lists which SE are used/are not used in the game (listed in the game script)

Please note that are a few `wa_XXX` SE which are used in the engine which are NOT listed below, and these must be considered when making SE packs.

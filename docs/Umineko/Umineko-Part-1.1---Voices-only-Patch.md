So, you like the Ryukishi art. I get it, I also like it a lot. In that case, we got you covered.

Beware that some bugs and features might be missing in these patches, as compared to the 'full patch'.

## Regarding Saves (Please Read)

Saves are NOT compatible between the stock game and the patched game. Saves between different versions of the patched game may or may not be compatible - they might skip you forwards / backwards in the script. For this reason, if you are 'updating' your script, you should do so after completing an episode. You could also load a very old save to determine if there is any offset in the script, but please be careful not to spoiler yourself by loading an incompatible save. 

## Installing the patch

1. Find and open your game folder (open your Steam library, choose the game from the list, right click on it and click on ``Properties``. Switch to the ``LOCAL FILES`` tab and click on ``Browse local files...``)
2. Rename the file ``0.utf`` to ``0_old.utf`` (Backup the original script)
3. Download the ``0.u``, and place it inside the game folder. **MacOSX Only**: you might need to rename the `0.u` file to `0.utf`
4. Download the Umineko Voices `.zip`, and extract it inside the game folder. You should now have a folder called ``voice`` inside the root directory of the game
5. This step differs depending on your operating system
    - **Windows, Linux**: Download the Windows/Linux executable, and overwrite the existing executable in the game folder 
    - **MacOSX**: Download the zip file, but extract it to a known good location like desktop/downloads/documents, OUTSIDE the game directory. This will give you a `.app` file. Only then, copy the `.app` file into the game directory. This is to avoid a MacOSX security feature which prevents the game from running correctly (will give you a 'script not found').  

6. **Answer Arcs only:** Extract the file ``UminekoChiruVO-Update1.zip`` the game folder. Overwrite if asked.

## Lost your saves? Fix here.

Rename your folder ``saves`` to ``mysav``, this should restore your progress when using the new executable.

## Mod Settings

You can change some settings from the in-game mod menu. While playing the game and the text is not animating, right click to bring up the menu. Click the right hand side options/menu button. This shows the options allowing you to change the music and voice volume.
